# Recursion Visualizer

A simple web app that draws sequence diagrams for recursive algorithms using Excalidraw.

## üîß How it works

The app runs modified versions of recursive algorithms that log a trace of how the functions execute.

The trace consists of the following events :
- Function entry
- Function return
- Output during execution

This trace is then used to build a sequence diagram using [Excalidraw elements](https://docs.excalidraw.com/docs/@excalidraw/excalidraw/api/excalidraw-element-skeleton).

### Available algorithms

- Factorial
- Fibonacci
- Merge Sort

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running locally

- Clone repository
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

## üíª Built with
